        Hi! My name is Dan Arbelo. I am a Full-Stack Web developer. One of the things I have realized in so many professional environments is that "less is more".
        That is something that is even more consistent in coding. Whether it's simple HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Handlebars.js, and even within the MERN stack itself!
        One of the things I have always prided myself on is not only taking the time to fully understand what tools I have to work with, but more importantly what is the most efficient way to
        apply them!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
        I have developed a fairly deep love for designing a user experience that is not overwhelming to a new-comer, but is also memorable to a those who have seen a few things.
        </p>
